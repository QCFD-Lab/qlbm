Tutorials
================================

We are working on integrating the current tutorials into the web documentation.
Currently, Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the features of ``qlbm`` are available 
`in the demos directory of the GitHub repository <https://github.com/QCFD-Lab/qlbm/tree/main/demos>`_.
Check the ``README`` of the directory for an explanation of the different available demos.
