# Tutorials

We are going to go through 8 tutorials that cover the end-to-end experience of both using and developing quantum algorithms in `qlbm`.

## Installation

We are using version `0.0.5` of `qlbm`. To install it in a virtual environment, you can use the commands listed below. Make sure the environment is created using **Python 3.12** or **Python 3.13**.

```
python3.13 -m venv tutorial-venv
source tutorial-venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install qlbm[cpu,dev,docs]
```

Following this installation, you can start up `jupyer lab` or run the notebooks in your preferred environment.
