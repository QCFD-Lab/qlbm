class Reinitializer(ABC):
    """
    Base class for all algorithm-specific reinitializers.
    A ``Reinitializer`` uses the information at information available
    at the end of the simulation of 1 or more time steps
    to new initial conditions for the following time steps.
    Such information includes the quantum state and counts extracted from it.
    Novel initial conditions are inferred automatically based on
    the requirements of the algorithm under simulation, and
    an on-the-fly :class:`.CircuitCompiler` automatically converts
    them to the appropriate format to enable compatibility with the already transpiled circuits.
    For convenience, all reinitializers provide a uniform :meth:`reinitialize` interface,
    which takes as input both the quantum state and the counts performed during simulation.
    Its implementation may choose to ignore one of those inputs, depending on the
    algorithm and implementation.
